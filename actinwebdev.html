                What makes Wind Breaker so unique is the shift that it continues mainly in between life and sport. There is no exaggeration when we say that Wind Breaker has unrealistic figures along with the action that the heroes perform. Even then, it does not drift away entirely from reality. Why do we say that? Because the characters don’t go strong overnight. There’s a single tournament that lasts throughout the year. The protagonist and their opponents can both be pretty good and stand among the best players. We are not sure if you have ever taken the right kind of bike race. <br> <br>
                You would love this manhwa because of the background story of the different characters. Not only that, the background stories they have allotted are very serial. The main protagonist is constantly forced by his family to study. Sometimes, the mother is not doing well, while other times, they are too poor to treat their family members. These backstories also made way to create the most memorable moments. Besides, most of the characters that you will come across are indeed interesting. The protagonist is a nerdy character with a severe lack of social skills to meet new people. Then there is a playboy who keeps wanting to escape these problems. Another debauchery is a person who is kind in general but can also lose their patience very easily.
